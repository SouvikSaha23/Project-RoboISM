Changing and Developing rules --->

1. Write html pages by suitable names, eg. frontpage, about_us, etc. General names like layout, first etc. will be rejected.
2. Write CSS codes in seperate files as much as possible, giving them suitable names. For easier interaction, keep css files like-
    - arrangement.css : for arrangements, position, and margin of divisions. 
    - style.css: for styling elements, giving them color, changing fonts etc.
3. Write Javascript and Jquery codes in different files as much as possible, giving them suitable names. 
4. ALWAYS Try to comment what are you doing. Don't clutter with comments though. Spagetti code strictly forbidden. 
5. Keep images different, do not always link them from other websites. For better result, include both local address and url. 
6. Always try to make the page responsive. Use flexbox, grid model etc. Use bootstrap or w3css for better responsive layout.
